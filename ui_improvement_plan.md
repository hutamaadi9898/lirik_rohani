# UI Improvement Plan (Minimalist Refresh)

- [x] Baseline audit: review home hero copy, search island states, lyrics page chrome, and current animation usages.
- [x] Simplify visual system: reduce background clutter, keep one accent color, and ensure Space Grotesk is primary font.
- [x] Copy rewrite: replace technical terms on index with user-friendly wording and concise helper text.
- [x] Search island pass: streamline layout, soften animation (small lifts only), keep lucide icons minimal, improve loading/empty states.
- [x] Lyrics detail pass: rebuild HTML shell with simpler spacing, single accent pill, clean back link, consistent typography.
- [ ] QA sweep: mobile check, focus states, and reduced motion verification after deploy build.
